Human trafficking is the 2nd largest illicit industry in the U.S., 2nd only to the drug trade

There are 40.3 million trafficked persons globally today and 25% of them are children (Liberate Children, International Labour Organization). Forms of Child Trafficking include forced marriage, begging, sweatshops, pornography, migrant farming domestic labor, sextourism, armed groups (commonly known as child soldiers) (Unicef)

Child Sex Trafficking Is a Global Problem

Child Sex Trafficking refers to the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, obtaining, patronizing, or soliciting of a minor for the purpose of a commercial sex act. Force, fraud or coercion do not need to be present for the crime to be considered child sex trafficking.

Every 40 seconds, A Child Goes Missing

Every 40 seconds, a child goes missing or is abducted in the United States. Approximately 840,000 children are reported missing each year and the F.B.I. estimates that between 85 and 90 percent of these are children.

## Unveiling Shadows:

## Exposing the Horrors of Child Sex Trafficking in the U.S. and Worldwide

Human trafficking generates an estimated $150 billion in profits per year.

Child sex trafficking is a disturbing crime that affects children globally. This illegal act, despite its severe and lasting harm, often goes unnoticed or ignored by the general public, _"Out of sight, out of mind."_

The lack of awareness about this horrific crime raises serious concerns about the limited coverage in the media, the inadequacy of current laws to fight against it, and a societal reluctance to confront and address the problem. Together, we must work to bring this criminal issue to light, strengthen legal protections, and foster a collective commitment to ending this devastating and unlawful practice.

The vast, global scale of human trafficking has led it to become one of the most lucrative illicit businesses. The International Labor Organization (ILO) reported in 2014 that **human trafficking generates an estimated $150 billion in profits per year** globally. This staggering figure represents both labor and sex trafficking, and unfortunately, sex trafficking - including the trafficking of children for sexual exploitation - is known to yield higher profits for traffickers due to the repeated exploitation of victims.

## The Scope and Magnitude of the Issue

One in six runaways are likely victims of child sex trafficking.

The International Labor Organization (ILO, 2017) estimates that 1.2 million children are trafficked annually worldwide. In the U.S., the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC, 2020) reported that of the nearly 26,300 runaways in 2020, **one in six was likely a victim of child sex trafficking.** This prevalence suggests a considerable underreporting of cases due to the clandestine nature of this crime and the stigmatization and fear that victims face.

Obtaining accurate figures specifically for child sex trafficking is extremely challenging due to the **secretive and illegal nature** of the activity. Precise numbers can vary greatly, reflecting the differences in individual situations such as the geographical location, the age and perceived attractiveness of the victim, the brutality of the trafficker, and the "market" demand. While it is not possible to provide a definitive monetary value for this horrific crime, it is abundantly clear that the financial gain for traffickers is considerable, further fueling this tragic industry.

**Recognizing the significant financial incentives behind child sex trafficking is essential for effectively combating it.** Approaches should include the strengthening of legal penalties for traffickers and their financial facilitators, improving the detection and prevention capabilities of financial institutions and law enforcement agencies to identify and freeze the assets of traffickers, and increasing international cooperation and information sharing to disrupt cross-border trafficking networks.

## The Silence of the Media

The controversial and sensitive nature of the subject makes it a challenging issue to report on without potentially alienating audiences or crossing ethical boundaries.

The mainstream media's reluctance to consistently cover child sex trafficking could be attributed to several factors. Primarily, **the controversial and sensitive nature of the subject makes it a challenging issue to report on without potentially alienating audiences or crossing ethical boundaries** (Sullivan & Jeffreys, 2011). Additionally, there is an implicit bias in the media towards more 'visible' and less complex stories, making it easier to overlook systemic issues such as human trafficking (Herman & Chomsky, 1988).

## Our Mission is to Raise Awareness

The movie "Sound of Freedom" was the inspiration for this website.

**The mission of this website** is to raise awareness, provide resources and partner with other organizations that fight for the victims of child trafficking. Together, we can protect the innocence of children and give them the opportunity to live a life free from fear and exploitation.

Like many others, we were initially unaware of the global extent of child sex trafficking until the film "The Sound of Freedom" opened our eyes and inspired the creation of this website.

## Legislative Inadequacies

While legislation against human trafficking exists both in the U.S. and internationally, its application and enforcement often fall short.

**While legislation against human trafficking exists both in the U.S. and internationally, its application and enforcement often fall short.** In the U.S., the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA, 2000) was enacted as the first comprehensive federal law to address trafficking. However, under-reporting of cases, difficulties in victim identification, and cross-jurisdictional challenges hamper its full implementation (Musto, 2009). Internationally, UN protocols against trafficking are often not adequately enforced due to lack of resources, corruption, and inconsistencies in national laws (UNODC, 2018).

## Methods of Abduction and Subsequent Impacts

Psychological manipulation, coercion, abduction, and deceit are just some of the methods child sex traffickers use to entrap their victims.

**Child sex-traffickers often employ methods of psychological manipulation, coercion, abduction, and deceit to entrap victims** (U.S. Department of State, 2020). Once ensnared, victims often experience physical and emotional trauma, long-term psychological distress, and social stigma that can persist long after they escape or are rescued (Zimmerman & Watts, 2003). A victim's ability to trust others, form healthy relationships, and integrate into society is often significantly impaired.

## Organ Trafficking and Ritualistic Killing

Crimes against children involving organ trafficking and satanic rituals, including child-sacrificing are taking place around the world.

Organ trafficking is a known problem, with the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating that up to 10,000 illegal transplants may take place worldwide each year. The victims of organ trafficking are typically from impoverished communities and are often deceived or coerced into giving up their organs. While some reports have linked organ trafficking to human trafficking networks, the extent of this overlap, particularly in regards to trafficked children, is not definitively known.

Crimes against children involving ritualistic practices, including mutilation and child-sacrificing, stand as deeply unsettling and severe criminal offenses. These ritualistic crimes, found in various regions around the world, are often tied to belief systems that utilize human body parts in rituals. Addressing these horrifying acts demands a multifaceted approach, one that unites legal measures, social consciousness, educational efforts, and international collaboration.

## Moving Forward: Policy Suggestions and Awareness Measures

Policies should focus on stricter enforcement of existing laws, improving victim identification, and strengthening international cooperation.

To combat child sex trafficking, comprehensive, multi-pronged efforts involving policy changes, awareness campaigns, and victim support initiatives are required. Policies should focus on stricter enforcement of existing laws, improving victim identification, and strengthening international cooperation. Public awareness campaigns should aim at debunking common misconceptions about human trafficking, promoting recognition of signs of trafficking, and encouraging reporting.

Media outlets should be encouraged to handle the issue with sensitivity but without shying away from it. NGOs and educational institutions can also play an essential role in conducting research, providing education and training, and offering support to survivors.

In conclusion, the fight against child sex trafficking requires persistent, global commitment and concerted efforts from governments, media, NGOs, and individuals alike. Only then can the world hope to eradicate this scourge from our societies.
