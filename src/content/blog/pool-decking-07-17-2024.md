    ### Consider both aesthetics and functionality when choosing materials.
    
    When summer gets in full swing and the temperature starts climbing, it’s time to hop in the pool. If you are considering upgrading your pool deck or are in the design phase of your new outdoor oasis, there are a few things to consider when choosing which products you will use to surround your pool. When designing an outdoor patio, looks can often be a top priority when selecting the products to be installed, however around a pool, functionality should be equally considered. Luckily, there are several options for your pool deck that combine great looks with great functionality.

    ### Paving surfaces can get hotter than the air temperature.
    
    In the heat of the summer, paving surfaces can typically run significantly hotter than ambient air temperatures. Considering you and your guests will likely be relaxing around the pool barefoot, what you choose to pave your pool deck with can be the difference between a surface that may be unpleasant to walk on, and one that keeps its cool.

    ### Natural Travertine and Marble Pavers Remain significantly cooler than concrete and dark flagstone.
    
    Natural travertine and marble pavers have long been a popular patio choice in hotter climates as these stone pavers remain significantly cooler compared to concrete pavers and other dark flagstone options. Travertine and marble paving slabs are available in various sizes and can be purchased all as one size, or a mix-size pattern. Coupled with the fact that travertine and marble are often available in matching pool coping to tie everything together, they can be a great choice around a pool.

    ### Porcelain Tile is Ultra-durable and offers great grip and traction, even when wet.
    
    Another rising star in pool decking is porcelain tile. These large slabs are ultra-durable and use manufacturing techniques that lead to a surface that offers great grip and traction, even when wet. Choosing porcelain tile pavers not only allows you to design a great, contemporary looking patio, but also one that increases safety around the pool. Available in large individual sizes as well as mix size options with matching copings, porcelain pavers are another great choice around the pool.
