# Git CheatSheet

Creating a branch in Git is a great way to try out new features or make changes without affecting the main codebase. Here’s how you can do it:

## 1. **Check Your Current Branch**
   First, make sure you're on the branch where you want to branch off from (usually `main` or `master`):
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   This will show you which branch you're currently on.

## 2. **Create a New Branch**
   To create a new branch, use the following command:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch-name
   ```
   Replace `feature-branch-name` with a name that describes the feature or work you’re doing. For example, if you're working on adding a login feature, you might name the branch `add-login-feature`.

## 3. **Push the Branch to Remote (Optional)**
   If you want to push your new branch to a remote repository, use:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature-branch-name
   ```
   This makes the branch available to others who are working on the same project.

## 4. **Work on Your Branch**
   Now you can make your changes, commit them, and push them to your new branch. All changes will be isolated to this branch.

## 5. **Switch Between Branches**
   To switch back to the main branch (or any other branch), use:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
   Or to switch to another branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch-name
   ```

## 6. **Merge the Branch (When Ready)**
   Once you’re happy with the changes in your branch, you can merge them back into the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature-branch-name
   ```

## 7. **Delete the Branch (Optional)**
   After merging, if you no longer need the branch, you can delete it:
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature-branch-name
   ```
   If you’ve pushed the branch to a remote and want to delete it there too:
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete feature-branch-name
   ```

That’s it! You now have a new branch to experiment with and keep your main codebase clean.
